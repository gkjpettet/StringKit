# StringKit
A Xojo module providing additional String-related methods.

## Unicode categories
StringKit returns the Unicode category (as a `UnicodeCategories` enumeration) of a single `String` character using its `GetUnicodeCategory()` method. Internally it creates a `Dictionary` mapping codepoints to their corresponding enumeration. The code to initialise this Dictionary is generated from a string constant in the module named `kUnicodeCodepointCategoryPairs`. The value of this string is the contents of the file created by the CLI `UnicodeCategoryTool` which can be found within the `tools` folder. You shouldn't have to use this but you can run it to recreate an up-to-date version of the codepoint:category pairings if you like. The tool requires the `UnicodeData.txt` file originally pulled from [https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt]() but also saved in the `/resources` folder. A version of the outputted `codepoint-categories.txt` file can also be found in the `/resources` folder.
